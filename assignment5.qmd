Due date: Monday, November 25 at midnight.

‚è≥ We recommend reading through each problem ASAP so you can accurately estimate the time needed to complete the assignment.

-   **This is not an assignment to start the night before the due date!**

-   The assignment covers material all the way up to the Monday 11/18 lecture, so be sure to start working on problems as soon as you learn the requisite material.

Unless otherwise stated, assignments in STAT 131A are to be done individually.

-   As stated in the syllabus, the use of any LLM other than PingPong is considered cheating, unless otherwise indicated.

-   See the syllabus for the full course collaboration policy.

Some components of this assignment have not been seen by a previous cohort of STAT 131A students, so there may be some unforeseen hiccups.

-   If anything seems confusing or unclear, please post in the HW3 thread on Ed. We are here to support you!

## üìÆ Submission

Submit your assignment via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/833089).
The Gradescope will be live at least a few days before the HW deadline.

-   Make sure to tag your answers properly on Gradescope, or else you may be docked points for making the grading process more time-consuming.

**You must submit a PDF of any PingPong chats that include code you used in your submission.**

-   This should take the form of one long PDF.
    One way to do this is to copy all of your relevant PingPong chats into a Google Doc, and then print the doc as a PDF.

-   You are responsible for understanding all the code you submit, regardless of whether or not you used PingPong for help.

**For the coding component, you will produce both (1) a .Rmd file with your code and (2) an PDF file containing the code and output.**

-   On Gradescope, you will submit a single ZIP file containing both the .Rmd and PDF files.

-   To generate a PDF of your code and output, do not knit to PDF.
    Instead, knit your .Rmd file as HTML, open the HTML file in a web browser, and then **print the HTML as a PDF, making sure that none of your code or output is cut off.** You can generate an HTML file in RStudio by pressing `Knit` and then `Knit to HTML`.

-   The knitting process will not work if there are errors in your code, so be sure to leave plenty of time to knit your lab notebooks before the deadline.

-   Proofread your PDF to make sure all of your answers and plots are visible.
    If your PDF file is really long, it is possible that your code is printing out a large dataset or a really long vector.
    Make sure to comment out any code that prints more information than each question asks you for.
