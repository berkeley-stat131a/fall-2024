## Announcements ðŸ“£

If you are interested in completing a **custom project**, it is critical that you meet with a member of the course staff before HW6 is due (Monday 12/9 at midnight).

You can sign up for a 15-minute project meeting [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jQyyKDrdF7UDHu40CWj5WTdIBn6w3iIbJmG8MRmqZRA/edit?usp=sharing).

If you intend to complete the [default project](project.html), you do not need to sign up for a meeting.

## Schedule ðŸ“…

<!-- For a style similar to that of [Stat 20](https://stat20.berkeley.edu/fall-2024), modify `index.qmd` to point to `assets/{schedule-alt.ejs,buttons-alt.ejs}` and to `{schedule-alt.yml,buttons-alt.yml}` and `_quarto.yml` to point to `assets/styles-alt.scss`. -->
