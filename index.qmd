## Announcements ðŸ“£

Complete the [follow-up anonymous course pulse check](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScA0iGxbSywthqlpyDOjHMLdET66o66dAKX2xM57xq0DzZWtw/viewform?usp=sf_link).

[HW4](assignment4.html) is due Monday 11/4 at midnight.

[Lab 8](assignments.html) should be completed by Friday 11/1 to prepare you for HW4.

- But, there was a due date error on the website, so Lab 8 is not formally due until Friday 11/8.

- Note that Lab 9 will also be due on Friday 11/8.
