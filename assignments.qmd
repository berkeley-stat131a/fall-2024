<!-- In teams of 3 people (no more, no fewer), please complete the [project proposal form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYSFHSlrRKkcjCCo9PAGrtiWoWRQEQHGBsJsosEZfZ9ebocA/viewform?usp=sf_link). -->

<!-- To help assess the feasibility and suitability of your project, -->
<!-- please discuss your idea with the teaching staff before submitting your proposal. -->
<!-- Your group should -->
<!-- sign up for a -->
<!-- [15-minute meeting slot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gm0Dec4v061fLeEvg-N86jsOyG2TeNOJdtEScOrV1xs/edit?usp=sharing). -->
<!-- It is ideal if all members of your group can attend the meeting but, at a minimum, two members should be present.  -->
<!-- Your proposal does not have to be completed, or even started, when you meet with a member of the teaching staff. -->
<!-- But, you should have started thinking about potential topics and ideas. -->
<!-- **This meeting is a required part of the assignment.** -->

<!-- You are free to pursue any topic related to applied statistics. -->
<!-- In previous years, teams have considered -->
<!-- athletic performance, gender inequality, farming practices, restaurant quality, -->
<!-- music success, gentrification, and standardized testing, just to name a few. -->
<!-- Any data-driven investigation is fair game. -->

<!-- ~~**More specific instructions on final deliverables will be provided later in the quarter.** -->
<!-- In a previous iteration of the course, teams submitted either a 10-page report or a 10-minute presentation. -->
<!-- You can see past examples of successful final projects [here](https://jdgrossman.com/assets/mse-125-example-projects.zip). -->
<!-- The final deliverables will likely change for this iteration of the course.~~ -->

<!-- For more project details, see [the project page](https://jdgrossman.com/mse125/project). -->

<!-- Upon completing the project, we'll ask each student to evaluate the contributions of their team members, and we'll consider these peer reviews when determining final grades. -->

<!-- ## Peer evaluations for final project ðŸ‘¥ -->

<!-- Due date: ~~Friday, May 31~~ Monday, June 3, midnight PT -->

<!-- Confidential peer evaluations should be submitted separately by each team member.  -->

<!-- [Peer Eval Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzTPmpQIDCNR0df-Bc9u4fEmM0Y6uz6vPAWprhPd9w86SCBA/viewform?usp=sf_link). -->
