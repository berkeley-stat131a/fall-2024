<!-- **This meeting is a required part of the assignment.** -->

<!-- You are free to pursue any topic related to applied statistics. -->

<!-- In previous years, teams have considered -->

<!-- athletic performance, gender inequality, farming practices, restaurant quality, -->

<!-- music success, gentrification, and standardized testing, just to name a few. -->

<!-- Any data-driven investigation is fair game. -->

<!-- ~~**More specific instructions on final deliverables will be provided later in the quarter.** -->

<!-- In a previous iteration of the course, teams submitted either a 10-page report or a 10-minute presentation. -->

<!-- You can see past examples of successful final projects [here](https://jdgrossman.com/assets/mse-125-example-projects.zip). -->

<!-- The final deliverables will likely change for this iteration of the course.~~ -->

<!-- For more project details, see [the project page](https://jdgrossman.com/mse125/project). -->

<!-- Upon completing the project, we'll ask each student to evaluate the contributions of their team members, and we'll consider these peer reviews when determining final grades. -->

<!-- Confidential peer evaluations should be submitted separately by each team member.  -->
