The course will teach a broad range of statistical methods that are used to solve data problems, including group comparisons, standard parametric statistical models, multivariate data visualization, multiple linear regression and classification, classification and regression trees, and random forests. Students will be introduced to the widely used R statistical language and they will obtain hands-on experience in implementing a range of statistical methods on numerous real world datasets.\nIn short, Stat 131A will provide you with a Swiss army knife of foundational statistical methods to use for data science projects!\n\n\nLectures üßë‚Äçüè´\nMWF 2-3pm @ Morgan 101\nLecture attendance is mandatory. See below for more details.\n\n\nLabs üß™\nLab 101: Tuesday and Thursday, 11am-12pm @ Evans 330\nLab 102: Tuesday and Thursday, 4-5pm @ Hearst Mining Bldg 310 (Hearst is next to Evans Hall)\nYou should only be signed up for one lab group.\nLab attendance is optional, but highly encouraged.\n\n\nOffice hours (OH) üóìÔ∏è\n\n\nJosh‚Äôs Office Hours:\n\nMWF 1:45pm in Morgan 101 (before lecture)\nT+Th 5-6pm @ Evans 421\n\nVan‚Äôs Office Hours:\n\nWednesdays 10am-12pm @ Evans 434\nFridays 9am-11am on Zoom\nFor security reasons, Zoom links for OH are posted on bcourses.\n\n15-minute coffee chats with Josh on the phone (experimental!):\n\nOne slot every weekday at 9am.\nDesigned for individual advising, not logistical concerns or coursework help.\nFor example, we can talk about career plans or life advice.\nPlease limit to no more than one chat per month.\nBook at this link\n\n\n\nWe may add or reschedule OH if needed.\n\nPlease create a private Ed post if you have conflicts with all of the scheduled OH.\n\nComing to office hours does not send a signal that you are behind or need extra help. In fact, the students who come to OH are often the most successful in the course.\n\nOH is a great opportunity to discuss not only topics directly related to the course, but also anything else that‚Äôs on your mind.\nWe also welcome questions about career trajectories and research opportunities at UC Berkeley and beyond.\nKeep in mind that you do not need to come to office hours with an agenda. Listening in is welcomed and encouraged!\nFinally, attending and participating in office hours is a great way to set yourself up for a terrific letter of recommendation. This is true for most courses!\nIf you don‚Äôt already, I highly recommend that you attend the instructors‚Äô office hours in other classes from time to time.",

It is preferable to use a phone to submit conceptual questions and neighbor discussion answers during lecture.\nThis article explains why we have the laptop policy.

Each additional absence will impact your lecture attendance grade.\n\nIf you cannot attend a lecture due to an extenuating circumstance, please complete the lecture attendance excusal form before the lecture starts.\n\nThis form can be completed months, weeks, or days in advance of lecture.\n\nAcceptable extenuating circumstances include:\n\nIllness. DO NOT come to class if you are sick! Even a sniffle!\nPersonal emergencies.\nImportant life events (e.g., weddings)\nPre-planned collegiate athletic events in which you are a participant.\nThis list is not exhaustive. If you think an absence should be excused, complete this form and explain your reasoning. We cannot guarantee that your absence will be excused, but we will be reasonable.\n\n\nConcept checks ‚úÖ\nWe will use in-class concept checks and neighbor discussions to track attendance.\n\nConcept checks are not graded.\nConcept checks are answered via this form. \nSubmitting a concept check outside of standard lecture time is considered cheating and an honor code violation.

    "text": "Textbooks and resources üìñ\nEverything you need to know for Stat 131a will be covered in lectures, labs, and assignments.\n\nIt is possible to do very well in Stat 131a without ever referring to an outside textbook or resource.\n\nHowever, most of the course material is covered by the online textbook developed specifically for 131A.\n\nYou can find the textbook here.\n\nThe StatQuest YouTube Channel is an excellent resource.\n\nStatQuest provides videos on many of the topics we will cover in class. The instructor is very entertaining!\n\nIf you would like some additional optional reading, you can try the following books.\n\nTheory Meets Data by Ani Adhikari. This is the online book for STAT 88 that covers introductory probability at the level of Stat 20.\nR for Data Science, by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. This is a free online book that covers the tidyverse set of R packages.\nThe Statistical Sleuth: A Course in Methods of Data Analysis by Ramsey and Schafer\nIntroductory Statistics with R by Peter Dalgaard\n\nNone of these books covers all of the topics we will cover in 131A, nor do they necessarily have the same perspective and focus as this class.  But for those students wanting some additional structure or R assistance, these books may be helpful and should be at the right level for this class.\nStat 20 and Data 8 are similar courses, but each covers some subjects that the other does not. While we will cover these topics in class, you may find the following useful background if you are seeing them for the first time (more to follow):\n\nComputational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data Science, by Ani Adhikari and John DeNero ‚Äì chapters 11-13.\n\nThis is the online book used by Data 8. These chapters introduce hypothesis testing using only resampling ideas, ideas which are not necessarily covered in Stat 20.",

    "text": "Policy on Large Language Models (LLMs) üí¨\nLLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) are becoming increasingly essential in the workplace.\n\nTo that end, the use of LLMs is not only permitted in this course, but encouraged.\nUse this course as an opportunity to learn where LLMs are most useful, and where they fall short.\n\nPotential uses of LLMs in Stat 131A:\n\nGenerating practice quiz questions\nExplaining course concepts\nHelping you code\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, you can only use the course-approved LLM PingPong for help on labs, homework, and the final project..\n\nFurthermore, if you use PingPong to help you, you must submit a PDF of the relevant PingPong conversation along with your assignment.\nYou are responsible for understanding every line of code that you submit in 131A. Exams may ask you to explain specific lines of code used in lab and HW solutions. So, don‚Äôt use LLMs to write code without taking time to understanding the code.\nOf course, LLMs cannot be used on exams.\n\nIt is often easy to spot default LLM text output.\n\nIf you copy and paste answers directly from PingPong, be warned that your grader may interpret your answer as lacking in effort and you may lose points on the assignment.\nTake the time to understand and paraphrase the information LLMs provide you.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you find an especially interesting use case of an LLM for any component of the course, please share it with the course staff! We are excited to hear what you find.",
