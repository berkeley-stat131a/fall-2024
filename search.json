    "text": "📮 Submission\nSubmit your assignment via Gradescope.\n\nMake sure to tag your answers properly on Gradescope, or else you may be docked points for making the grading process more time-consuming.\n\nYou must submit a PDF of any PingPong chats that include code you used in your submission.\n\nThis should take the form of one long PDF. There are lots of free tools for stitching together PDFs.\nYou are responsible for understanding all the code you submit, regardless of whether or not you used PingPong for help.\n\nFor coding components, you will produce both (1) a .Rmd file with your code and (2) an HTML file containing the code and output.\n\nOn Gradescope, you will submit a single ZIP file containing both the .Rmd and HTML files.\nYou can generate an HTML file in RStudio by pressing Knit and then Knit to HTML.\nThe knitting process will not work if there are errors in your code, so be sure to leave plenty of time to knit your lab notebooks before the deadline.\nProofread your HTML to make sure all of your answers and plots are visible. If your HTML file is really long, it is possible that your code is printing out a large dataset or a really long vector. Make sure to comment out any code that prints more information than each question asks you for.\n\nFor the plot presentation, there are two submission steps.\n\nFirst, submit a public link to your screencast via Gradescope. We will dock points and/or dock slip days if the link is not publicly accessible during grading. Test your link in an incognito window to ensure it’s public.\nSecond, submit the same public link to your screencast using this Google Form. This second step prepares us for HW2, when another student will provide anonymous feedback on your screencast.\n\nFor math problems, prepare a photo of your handwritten answers to each problem, convert the photo to a PDF, and submit the PDF to Gradescope.\n\nAlternatively, you can use \\(\\LaTeX\\) to typeset your answers within a .Rmd file within RStudio, or using another \\(\\LaTeX\\) editor like Overleaf.\nThe basics of \\(\\LaTeX\\) are useful to learn if you ever plan to include a mathematical expression in a presentation or document in the future.\nHere’s a nice guide for getting started.\nWe can also help with \\(\\LaTeX\\) in office hours or via Ed."

    "text": "🗣️ Plot presentation (30%)\nIn their 2013 research paper titled The Missing “One-Offs”: The Hidden Supply of High-Achieving, Low-Income Students, Caroline Hoxby and Chris Avery investigate the behavior of high-achieving low-income applicants to undergraduate programs in the United States.\nHere is Figure 10 of their research paper:\n\nYour task: Record a 60-90 second screencast describing the plot above.\n\nYour audience is a UC Berkeley undergraduate who has not taken a statistics or data science course, and is unfamiliar with the research paper. You do not need to read the research paper in full to understand the plot, but you might find it helpful to reference.\nIn your screencast, you must explain the minimum necessary background required to understand the plot, along with the key takeaway(s) of the plot.\nYour name and face should not be in the screencast. In other words, the plot should take up the entire window of the screencast, with your voice playing in the background. Do not introduce yourself or use any identifying information.\nYou should use your mouse pointer to indicate particular points of interest on the plot. Alternatively, you can verbally direct the viewer to points of interest (e.g., “In the top right corner, you can see that…”).\nYou should use an engaging tone that sounds as though you are presenting to a live audience.\nYou are welcome to read off a script that you have written ahead of time, but try not to make it too obvious. In fact, it can be very helpful to write a script for a presentation ahead of time, even if you do not actually read the script when presenting.\nRemember the three key guiding questions you should address before digging into the details: (1) What’s on the X axis? (2) What’s on the Y axis? (3) What does a specific point/line/feature on your plot mean in context?\nThere are lots of free tools for recording screencasts. For example, QuickTime is a useful tool for recording screencasts on a Mac. Feel free to post on Ed if you cannot identify a way to record a screencast anonymously.\nIf you need more than 60-90 seconds to record for accessibility reasons, please let the teaching staff know via Ed.\n\nAs part of HW2, you will provide anonymous feedback on another student’s submission for this problem.\n\nYour screencast, along with the quality of feedback you provide to another student, will be graded by the teaching staff. At no point will other students grade your work.\n\n💾 Upload your screencast to your UC Berkeley Google Drive account, or another place that allows you to share a public link.\n\nYou will submit a public link to your screencast in two places. See submission details at the top of this page.\nBefore submitting, make sure your screencast is publicly accessible with the link. One easy way to do this: Open the link in an incognito window in Google Chrome.\nIf your video is private or unviewable when we try to access it, we will not be able to confirm that you submitted your video before the HW1 deadline. You may lose points and/or have to use slip day(s).\n\nWhy complete this problem? Communication is a critical, but often under-appreciated, component of the data science life cycle. This exercise helps develop your data storytelling ability, which is essential for getting anyone to actually care about your statistical analyses!"

    "text": "Course Details 🥗\n\nDescription 🔎\nStat 131A is a upper-division course that follows Data 8 or STAT 20. The course will teach a broad range of statistical methods that are used to solve data problems, including group comparisons, standard parametric statistical models, multivariate data visualization, multiple linear regression and classification, classification and regression trees, and random forests. Students will be introduced to the widely used R statistical language and they will obtain hands-on experience in implementing a range of statistical methods on numerous real world datasets.\nIn short, Stat 131A will provide you with a Swiss army knife of foundational statistical methods to use for data science projects!\n\n\nLectures 🧑‍🏫\nMWF 2-3pm @ Morgan 101\nLecture attendance is mandatory. See below for more details.\n\n\nLabs 🧪\nLab 101: Tuesday and Thursday, 11am-12pm @ Evans 330\nLab 102: Tuesday and Thursday, 4-5pm @ Hearst Mining Bldg 310 (Hearst is next to Evans Hall)\nYou should only be signed up for one lab group.\nLab attendance is optional, but highly encouraged.\n\n\nOffice hours (OH) 🗓️\n\n\nJosh’s Office Hours:\n\nMWF 1:45pm in lobby outside Morgan 101 (before lecture)\nT+Th 5-6pm @ Evans 421\n\nVan’s Office Hours:\n\nWednesdays 10am-12pm @ Evans 434\nFridays 9am-11am on Zoom\nFor security reasons, Zoom links for OH are posted on bcourses.\n\n15-minute coffee chats with Josh on the phone (experimental!):\n\nOne slot every weekday at 9am.\nDesigned for individual advising, not logistical concerns or coursework help.\nFor example, we can talk about career plans or life advice.\nPlease limit to no more than one chat per month.\nBook at this link\n\n\n\nWe may add or reschedule OH if needed.\n\nPlease create a private Ed post if you have conflicts with all of the scheduled OH.\n\nComing to office hours does not send a signal that you are behind or need extra help. In fact, the students who come to OH are often the most successful in the course.\n\nOH is a great opportunity to discuss not only topics directly related to the course, but also anything else that’s on your mind.\nWe also welcome questions about career trajectories and research opportunities at UC Berkeley and beyond.\nKeep in mind that you do not need to come to office hours with an agenda. Listening in is welcomed and encouraged!\nFinally, attending and participating in office hours is a great way to set yourself up for a terrific letter of recommendation. This is true for most courses!\nIf you don’t already, I highly recommend that you attend the instructors’ office hours in other classes from time to time.",

It is preferable to use a phone to submit conceptual questions and neighbor discussion answers during lecture.\nThis article explains why we have the laptop policy. Long story short, laptop use can negatively impact the learning of nearby students (i.e., this policy does not punish you; the policy prevents you from punishing others).\nThe course staff reserves the right to reduce your lecture attendance grade for violating the technology policy.",

Each additional absence will impact your lecture attendance grade.\n\nIf you cannot attend a lecture due to an extenuating circumstance, please complete the lecture attendance excusal form before the lecture starts.\n\nThis form can be completed months, weeks, or days in advance of lecture.\n\nAcceptable extenuating circumstances include:\n\nIllness. DO NOT come to class if you are sick! Even a sniffle!\nPersonal emergencies.\nImportant life events (e.g., weddings)\nPre-planned collegiate athletic events in which you are a participant.\nThis list is not exhaustive. If you think an absence should be excused, complete this form and explain your reasoning. We cannot guarantee that your absence will be excused, but we will be reasonable.\n\n\nConcept checks ✅\nWe will use in-class concept checks and neighbor discussions to track attendance.\n\nConcept checks are not graded.\nConcept checks are answered via this form. \nSubmitting a concept check outside of standard lecture time is considered cheating and an honor code violation. We will use your seat number and submission time to validate that your responses were entered during lecture time. We reserve the right to photograph the lecture hall to verify attendance.\n\n\n\nNeighbor discussions 🗣️\nIn addition to concept checks, there may be one or more neighbor discussions during each lecture.\n\nNeighbor discussion answers are submitted via this form.\nNeighbor discussion answers are not graded.\n\nTo encourage discussion among all classmates, we will award up to two percentage points of extra credit for having a variety of neighbors.\n\nThe students with the highest number of unique neighbors will receive the full two percentage points of extra credit.\nEveryone else will receive, at the minimum, a fraction of extra credit proportional to their number of unique neighbors.\nFor example, if you sit next to the same person all semester, you can receive full participation credit for neighbor discussions, but you will very little extra credit.\nThe extra credit policy will only take effect if at least one student has spoken to at least 20 unique neighbors over the course of the semester.\nAs above, submitting a neighbor discussion answer outside of standard lecture time is considered cheating and an honor code violation.",

The instructor is very entertaining!\n\nIf you would like some additional optional reading, you can try the following books.\n\nTheory Meets Data by Ani Adhikari. This is the online book for STAT 88 that covers introductory probability at the level of Stat 20.\nR for Data Science, by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. This is a free online book that covers the tidyverse set of R packages.\nThe Statistical Sleuth: A Course in Methods of Data Analysis by Ramsey and Schafer\nIntroductory Statistics with R by Peter Dalgaard\n\nNone of these books covers all of the topics we will cover in 131A, nor do they necessarily have the same perspective and focus as this class.  But for those students wanting some additional structure or R assistance, these books may be helpful and should be at the right level for this class.\nStat 20 and Data 8 are similar courses, but each covers some subjects that the other does not. While we will cover these topics in class, you may find the following useful background if you are seeing them for the first time (more to follow):\n\nComputational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data Science, by Ani Adhikari and John DeNero – chapters 11-13.\n\nThis is the online book used by Data 8. These chapters introduce hypothesis testing using only resampling ideas, ideas which are not necessarily covered in Stat 20.",

Exams may ask you to explain specific lines of code used in lab and HW solutions. So, don’t use LLMs to write code without taking time to understanding the code.\nOf course, LLMs cannot be used on exams.\n\nIt is often easy to spot default LLM text output.\n\nIf you copy and paste answers directly from PingPong, be warned that your grader may interpret your answer as lacking in effort and you may lose points on the assignment.\nTake the time to understand and paraphrase the information LLMs provide you.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you find an especially interesting use case of an LLM for any component of the course, please share it with the course staff! We are excited to hear what you find.",
